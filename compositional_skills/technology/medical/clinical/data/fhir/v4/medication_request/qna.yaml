  - context: |
      A MedicationRequest is An order or request for both supply of the medication and the instructions for
      administration of the medication to a patient. The resource is called \"MedicationRequest\" rather than
      \"MedicationPrescription\" or \"MedicationOrder\" to generalize the use across inpatient and outpatient
      settings, including care plans, etc., and to harmonize with workflow patterns.
